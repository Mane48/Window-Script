# Window-Script
Window Script made for FiveM.


This window script allows the driver of the vehicle to control all front and back windows;
passengers can not control other windows besides theirs.

The script works with server side as well, meaning that if you do the command to roll down the window everyone will be able to see the window go down.

Known issues:
Windows rolled up or down Boolean doesn’t get restarted upon vehicle repair.
Getting into other vehicles while you had previously rolled down the window in another car does not get restarted when getting into another one.
Commands :
/wind all ( Rolls down all windows ) - Only driver can use this
/wind front ( Rolls down both front windows ) - Only driver can use this
/wind back ( Rolls down both back windows ) - Only driver can use this
/wind fl ( Rolls down front left )
/wind fr ( Rolls down front right )
/wind bl ( Rolls down back left )
/wind br ( Rolls down back right )

To roll down your window as a passenger you will have to roll down your specific window. If I’m sitting on the copilot seat I will have to do /wind fr as in front right.

Future Plans:
Making the script automatically detect if the vehicle window is rolled up and down Instead of it being a default true or false.
If you wish to remove the made by Terry L print feel free to do so.
